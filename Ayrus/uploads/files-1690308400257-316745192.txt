Topic -- Operator Overloading
	

Q1:- Create a C/C++ Program to demonstrate Operator Overloading Concept.
	1:)Write a C++ program to overload unary operators that is increment and decrement.
	   Increment ++ and decrement -- are the unary operators. 
           You need to take two numbers x and y as data member of the class and make 3 data member functions(2 for operator increment and decrement and 1 for display the data after increment and decrement)
        2:) Write a C++ program to overload binary operator '+' to add two complex numbers.
	   You need to add two complex number and display the data after adding these 2 numbers.
           Take 2 number as input data member of the class and 2 data member function. 1 for overloading and other for display.
        3:) Write a C++ program to overload binary operator '+' to add two complex numbers by using friend function. 
Q2:- Create a Class Clock which contains these 3 inputs as data members
	1:- hours
	2:- Minutes
	3:- Secodns
Then Write a C++ program which using operator overloading for the below operators.
	1:) << To Display the time.
	2:) >> To accept the time.
	3:) == To check whether the 2 time are same or not.

You need to take 2 set of input from the user and then execute the above 3 operations.
